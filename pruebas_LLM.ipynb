Use the given context as a support to answer the question if you can't answer the question.Context:  with almost 3,000 delegates. The NPC is often described as a \\\"rubber stamping\\\" body; it vetoed no bills and members have complained about their lack of power.\\n China largely follows a centralized system of government, and is administratively divided into 22 provinces, 5 autonomous regions and 4 directly controlled municipalities. Provincial governments have limited powers in their internal and economic affairs. Autonomous regions have more autonomy than provinces, such as the right to declare additional official languages and holidays in additional to Mandarin and other national holidays. Directly controlled municipalities are cities that are not part of any province, and instead report directly to the central government in Beijing. Often having different names, prefectures ((地级)市/自治州/地区), counties (县/(县级)市/区) and townships (乡/镇/街道) are one by one subordinated.\\n The Special Administrative Regions (SAR), Hong Kong and Macau, in principle run themselves as separate jurisdictions, with only foreign policy and defense being controlled by Beijing, though in practice this autonomy is restricted. There is an active independence movement in Hong Kong, but the imposition of the National Security Law in 2020 has largely driven the movement underground.\\n The PRC considers Taiwan to be one of its provinces, but Taiwan's government (the Republic of China) has been completely separate from the mainland Chinese one since 1949. Both governments on paper continue to claim to be the sole legitimate government for all of China. There is significant support for formal independence in Taiwan, but China's government has repeatedly threatened to launch a military attack on Taiwan if the island declares itself independent. See Chinese provinces and regions for more detail.\\n \\n People and customs[edit] \\n Minority cultures of China With 1.4 billion inhabitants, China is home to nearly a fifth of the world's population. It is a diverse place with large variations in culture, language, customs and economic levels from region to region, and often strong distinct cultural and regional identities as well.\\n The economic landscape is particularly diverse. The major cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai are modern and comparatively wealthy. However, about 50% of Chinese still live in rural areas even though only 10% of China's land is arable. Hundreds of millions of rural residents still farm with manual labor or draft animals. Some 200 to 300 million former peasants have migrated to townships and cities in\\n\\n that around major holidays, places may be closed when they're usually open or open when they would usually be closed.\\n \\n Time zones[edit] \\n Despite geographically spanning five time zones, all of China officially follows Beijing Time (UTC+8). However, in the restive province of Xinjiang, while the official time is Beijing Time, some ethnic Uyghurs use the UTC+6 time zone as a sign of defiance against Beijing.\\n \\n Read[edit] \\n Wild Swans by Jung Chang (ISBN 0007176155) - a biography of three generations, from the warlord days to the end of Mao's era, illustrating life under China's version of nationalism and communism. This book is banned in China. The Search for Modern China by Jonathan Spence - a standard history book on modern China from the late Ming to the current period. \\n See also[edit] \\n \\n Talk[edit] \\n Chinese phrasebook  The official language of China is Standard Mandarin, known in Chinese as Pǔtōnghuà (普通话, \\\"common speech\\\"), which is based on the Beijing dialect; Chinese in general is known as Zhōngwén (中文). Standard Mandarin is the main language for government and media, as well as the national lingua franca. While the official language is standardized, local pronunciation of Mandarin does vary by region. Unless otherwise noted, all terms, spellings and pronunciations in this guide are in Standard Mandarin. While national media is broadcast in Mandarin, each area often has its own local media that broadcasts in the local language.\\n Chinese is written using Chinese characters (汉字, hànzì, lit. \\\"Han characters\\\"). Unlike an alphabet that represents individual sounds without any inherent meaning, each Chinese character represents a meaningful syllable: a specific word or part of a word. Although they look impenetrable at first, there is some method to the madness: most characters are composed from base components combined with other characters (often giving clues to both pronunciation and general meaning). The same characters are used in Japan and Korea with usually similar meanings, albeit different pronunciations. However, since the 1950s mainland China has used simplified characters, such as 龟 instead of 龜, in an attempt to eradicate illiteracy. Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and many overseas Chinese still use the traditional characters, which are also sometimes used on\\n\\n\\n China (disambiguation) China (中国; Zhōngguó) is one of the world's oldest civilizations. Its long and rich history is present in people's thinking and values, and in the art, architecture, and feats of engineering that remain from dynasties past. In addition to its bustling and futuristic cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen, China boasts an incredible array of breathtaking natural wonders like the karst landscapes of Guilin and granite peaks of Huangshan that have inspired painters and poets for generations.\\n After a tumultuous 19th and 20th centuries, China has dramatically re-emerged as an economic powerhouse. Its rapid development has been paralleled by an ascent onto the international stage. Of course there are growing pains when high-rises and factories surge up to dwarf centuries-old pagodas, but there's also a strong sense of enthusiasm and optimism about what the future holds. If you visit now, you can see the relics of millennia of history and experience the signs of further transformations in progress.\\n \\n Regions[edit] \\n China's hierarchy of administrative divisions has 22 provinces (省 shěng) which tend to have their own cultural identities, and 5 autonomous regions (自治区 zìzhìqū), each with a designated minority ethnic group. These along with four municipalities (直辖市 zhíxiáshì) make up what is known as mainland China (中国大陆 Zhōngguó dàlù).\\n For the purposes of Wikivoyage, these provinces are grouped into the following regions:\\n Regions of China \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Cities[edit] \\n  Beijing Here are nine of China's most interesting cities for travelers.
